Colourful tassles sit in the top left hand corner of the poster and a drape comes down underneath the type to the centre of the composition on the right hand side. In the centre of the poster is an illustration of a woman dancing, with her necklace swinging. A man sits in front of  her on the ground playing the saxophone. In the background as some green bushes and a blue sky. ">

        <blockquote>"In Jazz, improvisation isn't a matter of just making any ol' thing up. Jazz, like any language, has its own grammer and vocabulary. There's no right or wrong, just some choices that are better than others."
            ― Wynton Marsalis</blockquote>
